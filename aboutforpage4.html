    <p>
        Bangtan Sonyeondan also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began formation
        in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.
        The septet—composed of <i><b>RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook</i></b>—co-writes and co-produces
        much of their ownoutput. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their
        lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of
        school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to
        literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. The group has released
        several albums and performed on several world tours.

                                                After debuting in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS released their first Korean-language studio
        album, Dark & Wild, and Japanese-language studio album, Wake Up, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio
        album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the
        global music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records. They
        became the first Korean group to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America
        (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop", as well as the first Korean act to top the US Billboard 200 chart with their
        studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018).
        
                                         <br>BTS also became the fastest group since The Beatles to earn four US
        number-one albums, doing so in less than two years. Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album
        certified platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the
        Billboard Global 200 and US Billboard Hot 100 with their single "Dynamite" and remix of "Savage Love (Laxed –
        Siren Beat)", and with the release of Life Goes On became the first group in chart history to have two number
        one Hot 100 debuts.<br>

        Having sold over 20 million albums on the Gaon Music Chart, BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean
        history and holds the best-selling album in South Korea with Map of the Soul: 7. BTS was ranked at number 45 on
        Billboard's Top Touring Artists of the 2010s, the only non-English speaking act on the list. During their Love
        Yourself World Tour, BTS became the first Asian and first non-English speaking act to headline and sell out
        Wembley Stadium and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in Rose Bowl Stadium history.
        Featured on Time's international cover as <i><b>"Next Generation Leaders"</b></i>, BTS has also appeared in the magazine's
        lists of the 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) and the 100 most influential people in the
        world (2019), where they were dubbed "Princes of Pop". Forbes Korea named BTS the most influential celebrities
        of Korea in 2018 and 2020, and BTS ranked 43rd in the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019) as one of the world's
        top-earning celebrities. As of 2019, BTS is purportedly worth more than $4.65 billion to South Korea's economy
        each year, or 0.3 percent of the country's GDP. They attract one in every 13 foreign tourists that visited South
        Korea and were cited as one of the key acts in boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018.
        <br>
        Following the establishment of their Love Myself anti-violence campaign in partnership with UNICEF, BTS
        addressed the United Nations 73rd and 75th General Assemblies and became the youngest ever recipients of the
        Order of Cultural Merit from the President of South Korea due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture
        and language
